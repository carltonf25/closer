## Dynamic Lead Pricing Logic

Lead prices are calculated using a base price multiplied by quality and demand factors.

**Base Price Factors**

- Trade (HVAC vs Plumbing)
- Market (city or cost index)

**Multipliers**

- Urgency (same-day): 1.3–1.6×
- Exclusivity: 1.4–1.6×
- Replacement scope: 1.8–2.5×
- Verified SMS response: 1.1–1.2×

Contractors are shown a transparent breakdown explaining each lead’s price.
